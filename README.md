# StraitsTimesScraper
Scrapes, organises and dates the daily Breaking News page of the Straits Times

## What I Learned
* Send HTTP Requests with Python
* Retrieve data from HTML and XML using BeautifulSoup
* Efficient parsing of necessary data from the HTML
* Formatting of data into a desired format in a CSV file
* Automatically create and save the CSV file with the date the website was scraped using the datetime module

## Additional Automation Suggestion
Schedule this file to run daily using Windows Task Scheduler and you can have a folder filled with the breaking news of the Straits Times website. With the name of the file being the day and date the programme was run, you will never lose track of the daily news and have an extensive archive of news articles.
